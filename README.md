## Hi there! 

This application uses the **U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database**.

Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. 
Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

Through the _date range_ and _event types_, on the side bar, you can interact with the graph on the **By year** tab.

The database has been obtained from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2).

Source code for the project is available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/jgfelixribeiro/Developing_Data_Products).

Presentation of the Shiny application is available on the [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/jgfelixribeiro/DevelopingDataProducts).
